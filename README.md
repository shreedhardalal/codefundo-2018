I propose a solution to assist ongoing and after disaster steps to recover from its effects. Many government schemes (Relief Funds) were specially implemented to help and recover people from disaster. The residents might not aware about such schemes. A platform to collect the data of affected population and propose a feasible solution according to allotted budget by government will solve problems currently arising in country during disaster. App would be user assistive to apply for relief and spread awareness for medical and financial help provided by NGOs and Government during disaster recovery stages.
In application the residents would be able to see mitigation steps to reduce sufferings from future happening disaster. The warnings and alerts would be propagated via application. The Application would also have a quiz to spread awareness and (Do’s and Don’ts) while situation of disaster to keep self-safe. E.g. while earthquake stay away from building on receiving a warning. This awareness would help most in reducing impact of disaster
According to disaster response plan, assistance would be provided to affected areas so one can simply fetch help by looking steps and direction visualized in app. As provided in google maps services or other service providers one can get nearest rehabilitation camps provided by government and voluntarily NGOs. One can access for remote recovery service if available due to disability of affected person.
