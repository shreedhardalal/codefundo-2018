I propose a solution to assist ongoing and after disaster steps to recover from its effects. Many government schemes (Relief Funds) were specially implemeted to help and recover people from disaster. The residents might not aware about such schemes. A platform to collect the data of affected population and propose a feasible solution according to alloted budget by government will solve problems currently arising in country during disaster. App would be user assistive to apply for relief and spread awareness for medical and financial help provided by NGOs and Government during disaster recovery stages.
